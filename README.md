# Project Description

Our goal is to design a platform where students are able to resell old books, furniture, etc among those around campus.  
### 1. Sign Up Process
  * Users will first be prompted to enter their:
    * Email
    * First Name
    * Password
    * Phone Number
  * The new user will then be authenticated via text message
### 2. Central Home/Hub
  * On this homepage, the user will be able choose between looking up products, buy products, and sell products.
### 3. Product Page
  * If user decides to view a product, they will see the following:
    * Image of the product
    * Price of the product (big green price tag)
    * State, City (where itâ€™s sold)
    * Local pickup location
    * Date / Time posted (how long ago)
    * Item Quality (new? Used? Old?)
    * Description of the Product
    * (tentative) **Map of the Pickup area**
    * (tentative) **Shipping price**
      * The initial scope of this project will be contained within IIT campus at first (campus platform to sell old/used items)
### 4. Selling UI / Posting Page
  * Alternatively, if a user wants to sell a product, they will need to enter this information via form:
    * Image of the product
    * Price of the product
    * (tentative) **State/City where is is sold / Pick Up Location**
      * The initial scope of this project will be contained within IIT campus at first (campus platform to sell old/used items)
    * Time + Date Posted
    * Description of the Product
### 5. Buying Process / Messaging UI
  * User should be able to interact with the seller via 2 options:
    * Send a message to ask questions about the product
    * Coordinate a pickup / selling location
